**Catch up with Reddit, Twitter, and Hacker News with customizable curation.**

[Ketchup.today](https://ketchup.today/) lets you catch up with the people and the topics that matter to you on your own terms. 

Just because a friend on social media posts multiple times a day, that doesn't make him or her more important than another friend that only post once a week.

Ketchup is an experiment to solve this problem by providing a basic configurable algorithm. We believe that letting you batch information by selecting your own interval is a better way of staying up to date. For the example above with the two friends, you would see one digest for each which enables you to allocate your time. This is by no means a perfect solution but it is a good step forward.

## Caveat
We are using emails for the digests (for now) so you must be familiar with organizing and archiving emails. It's not as bad as you might think but if you have a super busy inbox, we would recommend creating a "Ketchup" label or a separate email account.

## KEY FEATURES
- Supports Reddit, Twitter, and Hacker News (more on the way).
- Delivers content straight to your inbox.
- Customizable schedule.
- Filters (e.g. Exclude retweets)
